# Sqoop

Sqoop is a tool,part of hadoop ecosystem,which is mainly used for **importing** data from relational databases(RDMS) to Hadoop file system(HDFS) and **exporting** data from hadoop file system to relational databases.

Behind the scene,sqoop uses `Map reduce` to import and export the data set.Hence the processing will be parallel and fault tolerance.
